# Affect Modulation System

A comprehensive affect modulation system with logging-only operations as specified. This implementation provides robust emotion detection, state tracking, and affect-based routing calculations without taking actual actions.

## Overview

The Affect Modulation System consists of four main components:

1. **Emotion Detector** (`emotion_detector.py`) - Multi-modal affect detection
2. **Modulation Hooks** (`modulation_hooks.py`) - Hook system for affect processing
3. **Affect Logger** (`affect_logger.py`) - Comprehensive logging and persistence
4. **Affect Types** (`affect_types.py`) - Core data structures and type definitions
